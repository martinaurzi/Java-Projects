<p>You're an avid bird watcher that keeps track of how many birds have visited your garden in the last seven days.<br>You have six tasks, all dealing with the numbers of birds that visited your garden.</p>

<h3>1. Check what the counts were last week</h3>
<p>For comparison purposes, you always keep a copy of last week's counts nearby, which were: 0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8 and 4.<br>Implement the BirdWatcher.getLastWeek() method that returns last week's counts:</p>

> BirdWatcher.getLastWeek();<br> // => [0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8, 4]
